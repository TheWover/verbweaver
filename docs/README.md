## What is Verbweaver?

Verbweaver is a revolutionary writing and design platform that thinks in relationships (graphs). It's designed for:

- **Writers**: Organize your stories, characters, and worlds in interconnected nodes
- **Developers**: Track documentation, design docs, and technical specifications
- **Teams**: Collaborate on projects with full version control and task management
- **Anyone**: Who thinks in relationships and wants to organize their ideas

## Key Concepts

### Nodes
Every piece of content in Verbweaver is a node. A node can be:
- A markdown file with your content
- A task to track work
- A chapter, scene, or character in your story
- Documentation for your project
- Any file in your Git repository

### Edges (Links)
Nodes are connected by edges, which represent relationships:
- **Hard links**: Structural relationships (e.g., directory contains files)
- **Soft links**: Content relationships you define
- **Dependencies**: Task relationships
- **References**: Citations and cross-references

### Projects
Each project in Verbweaver is backed by a Git repository, giving you:
- Full version control
- Collaboration capabilities
- Offline access
- Integration with existing workflows

### Views
Verbweaver provides multiple views to work with your content:
- **Graph View**: Visualize relationships
- **Editor View**: Write and edit content
- **Threads View**: Manage tasks
- **Version Control View**: Track changes
- **Compiler View**: Export your work
